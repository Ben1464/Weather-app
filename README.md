## Description

  I built this weather app to provide a straightforward tool for accessing current weather conditions and forecasts by city, solving the problem of navigating multiple sources for weather information. It consolidates key data—temperature, humidity, and rain rate—into a single, user-friendly interface, helping users plan their activities based on accurate, up-to-date weather data. This project taught me how to integrate APIs, manage asynchronous operations with async/await, parse JSON, and dynamically update the UI based on user input.
